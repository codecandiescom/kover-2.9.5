        * kovertop.cc: little GUI redesign
        * When there is single front side (booklet and inlet of the same
          page), picture set for both front sides is ignored (I think

			 reported by Michal Rudolf <mrudolf@mercury.ci.uw.edu.pl>
          and fixed in cdview.cc
        * PreferencesDialog.cc: introduced some text to explain
          how and when the font changes are applied

2002-09-18 Adrian <adrian@lisas.de>

        * seems like we are entering a time of heavy development activity???
        * net.cc: introduced the readline method
          this should remove the bug reported 
			 by Jan Keirse <jan.keirse@pandora.be>:
          kover:cddb_fill.cc:702: this should not happen
          kover:cddb_fill.cc:810: this should not happen

          to read the http response by itself
        * koverfile.cc: cddb id is now also saved to the .kover files
        * koverfile.cc: first attempts to read .k3b files.

          two pages (misc and cover)

          format if necessary in the future
        * kovertop.cc: on the "More >>" page is a option to change
          the spine text independently from the title
        * finally the http_proxy environment variable is honored
          (net.cc, cddb.cc, PrefrencesDialog.cc)
        * due to changes to the configuration routines , there can be issues
          on first startup. kover will use its builtin values.
